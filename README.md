Final Project

Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Evening Sir Dan,

  As for my final project, I've been watching and reviewing each existing project that can be found on youtube
and so far, there are 3 different projects that I would like to recreate and more likely add or combine them w/
what codes that I know right now or other codes that already existed. The first project is about an Attendance 
System, second project is a calculator, the third project is a website for our business and fourth one is a todo
list. I will try to run every program that I looked up then decide which I can recreate and will be my final project.

--UPDATE!!!--
- I decided that I will work on creating a webpage, my third choice.
- I created another repository as to my old one keeps on failing to commit every new lines.
- After a lot of issues in the repository, gitbash and files used for the program, I'm finally done.

Special Thanks to Coding Is fun for the short yet rich with information on building a website for a beginner like me. 
I had a lot of fun and learned new things along the time I spend on analyzing, understanding and recreating the program 
he built. I highly recommended hischannel to watch whenever you feel lost and need to know more knowledge on coding 
programs that can enhance your skills and abilities.

and gitbash in which ayaw po mag commit ng new changes. Thank you po sir for understanding.
