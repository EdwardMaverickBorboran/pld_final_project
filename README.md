Final Project

Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Evening Sir Dan,

  As for my final project, I've been watching and reviewing each existing project that can be found on youtube
and so far, there are 3 different projects that I would like to recreate and more likely add or combine them w/
what codes that I know right now or other codes that already existed. The first project is about an Attendance 
System, second project is a calculator, the third project is a website for our business and fourth one is a todo
list. I will try to run every program that I looked up then decide which I can recreate and will be my final project.

--UPDATE!!!--
- I decided that I will work on creating a webpage, my third choice.
- I created another repository as to my old one keeps on failing to commit every new lines.
